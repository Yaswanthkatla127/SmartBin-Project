# Smart Bin: A Swachh Bharat Approach using NodeMCU (ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module)
•	The project aimed to create an automated waste management system to support cleanliness in urban and rural areas, aligning with India’s Swachh Bharat Mission.
•	The project utilized components like the NodeMCU (ESP8266 Wi-Fi module), an ultrasonic sensor, an LCD display, and a buzzer.
•	The NodeMCU enabled IoT functionality, allowing the system to notify users about the bin's status via the Blynk app, providing real-time updates and alerts when the bin is full.
•	Skills involved included programming in Arduino IDE, IoT integration, and hardware assembly.
•	The result was a functional prototype capable of monitoring waste levels and notifying users through mobile alerts, offering a sustainable approach to waste management.
